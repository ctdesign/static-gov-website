## Gov static site template

This is a forkable repo for making a quick static website that looks like GOV.UK. Have a look at this site here: https://ctdesign.github.io/static-gov-website/

Its for quick and dirty prototyping, powered by markdown. You _can_ run it locally but I find it quickest to edit it all via the Github website interface. Makes collaborating on content really easy.

It's a modified version of one of the default Github pages themes with some custom CSS and theme files to make it look like GOV.UK.

### Instructions

1. First fork this repo
2. Then go to Settings
3. Scroll down to the Github Pages section
4. Choose a source - choose 'master branch' if you're not sure
5. Click the 'Change theme' button and choose the Cayman theme.
6. That's it. Your site will be available to the public at: https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/

### Using github pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ctdesign/static-test/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ctdesign/static-test/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
